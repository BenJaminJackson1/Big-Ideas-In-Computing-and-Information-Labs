    "\n",
    "You're definitely going to get stuck at some point doing this assignment. When you do, there's a methodology that I think is helpful that you should try to develop. It comes from FreeCodeCamp (incidentally, a great resource for teaching yourself some coding), and it's called [Read-Search-Ask](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/read-search-dont-be-afraid-to-ask-743a23c411b4).\n",
    "\n",
    "These three steps will get you through these assignments, and the habit will help you throughout your life coding. They're basically as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Read.* Reread the error messages you get, reread the exercise description, read the relevant parts from the textbook, read over any code that might be given to you, read over any supplementary materials you might've gotten that relate to what you're doing. Try any solutions or potential changes that come to mind after reading or were suggested while you're reading. You can do that as many times as you want; it doesn't hurt anybody to try putting in another parenthesis and hit Shift-Enter again.\n",
    "2. *Search.* By now, you probably have a pretty good idea of what your problem is. Google it! Look on StackExchange, coding forums, and other websites. Don't copy and paste code (you know what plagiarism is) but try to see what others did that's different from what you have.\n",
    "3. *Ask.* If you're still in lab and you're stuck, raise your hand! If not, drop me or the instructor an email. Come to either of our office hours. We'll help you out.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Read-Search-Ask is going to be helpful; keep it in the back of your mind as you're doing these assignments."

    "Your task for this week is to extend this a little bit. Copy and paste the above code into a new code cell below. You're going to make three changes to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make `\"What is your name? \"` a variable. This makes it easier to reuse and change strings that you use across larger programs. After you've done that, change the line of code you use to prompt for the person's name so that, instead of saying `prompt=\"What is your name? \"`, it says `prompt=WHATEVER YOU NAMED YOUR PROMPT VARIABLE`. (Obviously, you'd put the name of your variable in there.)\n",
    "2. Notice how, when you ran the code cell at the beginning of the exercise, it printed your name with spaces around it, like, \"`Hello Sean !`\"?   \n",
    "Well, that doesn't look super great, so I want you to fix it. Use string *concatenation* (remember what `+` does when you use it with strings?) to insert the user's name that they enter into a string that says \"Hello\" to them. Then, instead of saying `print(\"Hello\", name, \"!\")`, you should be able to just do `print(WHATEVER YOU NAMED YOUR HELLO VARIABLE)`. Isn't that nicer? And no ugly spaces, too!\n",
    "3. One last thing: I want you to ask for the user's *age*, too. So, make another prompt where you ask \"What is your age? \". Do the same thing you did in step 1, and assign that string to a variable. You want both of your prompts *before* you print anything out.  \n",
    "So, now, you can change your print statement. Go ahead and concatenate the age onto the string you're printing out at the end. After you've done this, your program will go something like this:  \n",
    "\n",
    "> `What's your name?` (you type in your name, say \"Julie\")  \n",
    "> `How old are you?` (you type in your age, say \"19\")  \n",
    "> `Hi, Julie! You are 19 years old.`   \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, `Julie` and `19` would be replaced with whatever you entered.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: This is a lot to throw at you all at once. Consider this a bit of a challenge problem, especially if this is your first time doing any serious programming. If you don't get it all at once, or something breaks, don't feel frustrated! Come see me in office hours, or send me an email. "
